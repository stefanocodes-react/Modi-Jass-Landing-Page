**Problem Item 1** : Saturated Market

**Description: Within your first week on X, you will see that there are 100s of other creators offering the EXACT same service/product as you.**

And only 1% people choose to be their “Go-to.”

How will you stand out among them?

Why would clients choose you over them?

Do you really have the potential to do a good job?

**Problem Item 2**: Writing & Content.

**Description:** 90% of creators don’t know how to write or what to write about, and that’s why they gain 10 followers every 10 years and land 0 clients every 100 years.

**Problem Item 3**: Offer

\*\*Description: I will grow my followers then monetize later.

Every single creator thought this and they still fail to see any real progress in their business.

Every day feels like the same, Their followers count is growing but not their bank accounts.

And nobody slides into their DMs and hit them with “I wanna work with you”.

So how to fix that?
